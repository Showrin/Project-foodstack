<p>Before submitting the issue you must acknowledge that you&#39;ve read the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://leafo.net/sticky-kit/#reference">sticky-kit reference manual</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Thanks for reporting an issue. Sticky-kit is actually pretty complicated and
handles a lot of sticky scenarios. If the issue isn&#39;t immediately obvious when
written in text then you must include a minimal case example of the problem on
<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">http://jsfiddle.net/</a> or something similar to help save us some time.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re opening a pull request, remember Sticky-kit is written in
<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, so you should be applying your patch
to the CoffeeScript file and not the JavaScript files. Don&#39;t worry about
building/minifying the JS files, it will automatically be done on the next versioned release. In any case, you
can see how it&#39;s done in the
<a href="https://github.com/leafo/sticky-kit/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
